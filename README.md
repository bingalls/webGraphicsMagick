ImageMagick shell scripts to help manage images on your web site.

Requires GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick, and a Linux-like shell. Small, easy,
and recommended to read.

* apple-touch: 	 Convert an image to favicon and iPhone / iPad formats
* compressLossy: Speed your site with lossy compression
* gif2png.msl: 	 Example: gm conjure -file foo gif2png.msl

Enjoy compressLossy! Several free lossless compressors are available, but do
not compress as tightly as lossy compression. You must adjust, for your web
site's image quality needs, but I cannot percieve a difference at the default
40% quality. Images & JavaScript typically consume the most size & slowness
for web pages.
